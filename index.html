        <h2>My journey so far</h2>
        <p>I am actually a career shifter, who probably one of those stricken by the scarcity of employment opportunities when the pandemic hit. All the more I realized to make the jump sooner when I found a group in social media who are also mostly making the shift. And boy, it wasn't an easy one. I tried searching out resources online to give me an idea with the what, where, and how. I even started self-learning, and Python was the first step. Half-way on the course, I came across web frameworks, which sparked my interest in web development. With my wife's support, I signed up for <strong><a href="https://kodego.ph/">KodeGo</a></strong>'s bootcamp, and now we're on our second week (as of this writing).</p>
        <p>So, stick around as I move on with my journey to be a web developer and have this site updated as I go along. Thank you for visiting and God bless you!</p>
